## Programmatic Direct Dealmaking

The design of Filecoin is to allow clients to store large amounts of data for a long period of time.  For programmatic large-scale data storing (data >4GiB), a smart contract can be used to make a deal proposal via smart contract on the FVM directly with a storage provider.
This article explains the programmtic direct dealmaking process, via the [client contract](https://docs.filecoin.io/smart-contracts/developing-contracts/client-contract-tutorial/) example.

1. The client uploads a [CAR file](https://docs.filecoin.io/reference/general/overview/#data-prep-tools) of the data they would like stored on Filecoin to a web server and generates a Content ID (CID). There are [storage onramp](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/storage-onramps/) options to enable this. 

2. With the CID and CAR file URL, the client will deploy the client contract and propose a storage deal.  

3. Once the client contract is deployed, an event is emitted on-chain and storage providers who are running [Boost](https://boost.filecoin.io/experimental-features/fvm-contract-deals), will receive the deal proposal.  The storage provider will decide if they want to take the proposal and pick up the deal. There are a variety of factors influencing whether or not a storage provider will accept the deal, including if there is a pre-existing relationship between the client and the storage provider, whether the deal is financially attractive to the storage provider, if they can accommodate the size of the data, or whether clients have [datacap](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-storage-works/filecoin-plus/#datacap) (datacap is more applicable for mainnet than testnet).  

4. If the storage provider accepts the deal through Boost, the storage provider will download the CAR file from the web server, and publish the storage deal on chain.  A client can check that the deal was successfully published on the blockchain via [block explorers](https://docs.filecoin.io/networks/mainnet/explorers/). A storage deal published on-chain denotes the intent for a storage provider to make a storage deal, but does not mean that the deal is complete.  The deal is only completed once a storage provider has sealed the data into sectors and the dealID is published on-chain. More on dealmaking [here](docs.filecoin.io/basics/what-is-filecoin/storage-market/#deal-making). The timelines for the published storage deals and the dealID confirmation have undefined timelines.  Note this process can take hours to days, and this is because storage providers do not necessarily publish storage deals once they come in. Even if the deal is accepted on mainnet, depending on the size of the data, the storage provider may wait until they have enough data from other deals to fill a sector (see aggregated dealmaking for an alternative).  For the Calibration testnet, storage providers will pick up the deal within a day.
